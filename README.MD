## Synopsis

This app contains 102 hard-coded quotes about atheism based on the "Fun Facts" Treehouse Android application. They are displayed at random while randomly changing the color of the background. It is a very simple app just click the button. Creating it was a great introductory lesson about the Android framework.

## Motivation

Fun way to learn about Android application development with Android Studio as a part of Code Oregon 1.0, a state partnership between Oregon and Team Treehouse to teach programming skills to Oregon citizens.
